        <h1>My Autobiography</h1>
        <p>I am Noel T. Bingco Jr., a 2nd Year Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) student at MATS College of Technology. Ever since I was young, I have always been curious about how things work, especially when it comes to computers and technology. This curiosity eventually grew into a passion, leading me to pursue a degree in IT where I can explore programming, systems, and the digital world.</p>
        
        <p>I was born and raised in the Philippines, where I learned the importance of hard work, discipline, and determination. As a student, I strive not only to succeed in my studies but also to grow as a person. I enjoy learning new skills, solving problems, and challenging myself to improve. Though the journey is not always easy, I believe that every struggle I face helps shape the person Iâ€™m becoming.</p>
        
        <p>Outside of school, I have many interests. I love playing basketball, exploring technology, and spending time with people who inspire me. I believe in the power of dreams and the importance of staying true to who you are. My goal is to become a successful IT professional who can contribute meaningfully to the industry and make a positive impact on others.</p>
        
        <p>This is just the beginning of my story. I know that with patience, effort, and faith, I can achieve the future I envision.</p>
